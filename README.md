Project Description: User Authentication System with Node.js, Express, EJS, JWT, and MySQL

Overview
This (user authentication) project aims to create a secure and scalable authentication system using Node.js, Express, EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates), JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and MySQL database. The system will allow users to register, login, and authenticate themselves securely.

Key Features:

User Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password. Passwords should be securely hashed before storing them in the database to ensure confidentiality.

User Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their credentials. Upon successful authentication, users receive a JWT token, which they can use to access protected routes and resources.

JWT Token Generation: Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT token containing user-specific information and a secret key. This token is sent to the client and must be included in subsequent requests for authentication.

Protected Routes: Certain routes and resources within the application are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users. Middleware functions are used to verify JWT tokens and grant access to authorized users.

Session Management: The system should handle user sessions securely and efficiently using JWT tokens. Tokens should have expiration times to mitigate security risks associated with long-lived tokens.

Error Handling: The application should implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle various scenarios, such as invalid credentials, expired tokens, database errors, and server-side exceptions.

User Profile Management: Authenticated users should be able to manage their profiles, update personal information, and change passwords securely.

Database Integration: The application integrates with a MySQL database to store user accounts, authentication tokens, and other relevant information. SQL queries are used to interact with the database.

Project Structure:

index.js: Entry point of the application. Configures Express middleware, routes, and server settings.
routes: Contains route handlers for different endpoints such as user authentication, registration, profile management, etc.
controllers: Implements the business logic for various functionalities such as user authentication, registration, etc.
views: Contains EJS templates for rendering dynamic HTML content.
public: Static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
middlewares: Custom middleware functions for handling authentication, error handling, etc.
.env (you should include): Configuration file for setting up environment variables, database connection, JWT secret key, etc.

Dependencies:
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js
EJS: Templating engine for generating dynamic HTML content
JSON Web Token (jsonwebtoken): Library for generating and verifying JWT tokens
MySQL: Database management system for storing user data securely
bcryptjs: Library for hashing passwords securely
Sequelize (Optional): ORM library for interacting with MySQL database
